#Bookshrink - Find the essence#

###What is it?###
A website which picks out the most representative sentences from some amount of text - say, a research paper, or a book, or an essay, or *whatever*.

###Why?###
I'm interested in natural language processing - more than anything, bookshrink scratches my own itch.

###No really, why?###
Maybe it would be useful for anyone who needs to skim through a large amount of text!

Right now I'm being lazy, read the code!
Bottle.py?
